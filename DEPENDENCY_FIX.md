# Dependency Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was failing to start with the following error:
```
Error: The following dependencies are imported but could not be resolved:
  jspdf (imported by /Users/sk040d/myprojects/vet-cares/src/components/diagnostic/DiagnosticReportList.jsx)
```

## Root Cause
The `jspdf` dependency was being imported in the diagnostic report component but was not listed in `package.json`.

## Solution
Added the missing dependency to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "jspdf": "^2.5.1",
    // ... other dependencies
  }
}
```

## Verification
1. ✅ Installed the dependency: `npm install`
2. ✅ Started the development server: `npm run dev`
3. ✅ Confirmed server is running successfully on http://localhost:5173

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Added `jspdf: "^2.5.1"` dependency

## Usage
The `jspdf` library is used in:
- `src/components/diagnostic/DiagnosticReportList.jsx` - For generating PDF reports

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - Application now starts successfully without dependency errors.

---

**Note**: All other dependencies were already properly configured in package.json. The application is now ready for development and testing.
