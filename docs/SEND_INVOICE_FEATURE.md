- **Status Updates**: Automatically updates invoice status to "sent"
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback

### 🎨 **UI Components**
- **Send Invoice Button**: Added to both InvoiceList and InvoiceDetails pages
- **Loading States**: Shows "Sending..." with spinner during processing
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error feedback using toast system
- **Conditional Display**: Only shows for staff users and eligible invoices

## Implementation Details

### 📁 **Files Created/Modified**

#### New Files:
- `src/api/cloudflareR2.js` - Cloudflare R2 upload utilities
- `src/utils/invoicePdfGenerator.js` - PDF generation using jsPDF
- `src/api/whatsapp.js` - WhatsApp integration utilities
- `src/services/invoiceService.js` - Main service orchestrating the entire process

#### Modified Files:
- `src/components/billing/InvoiceList.jsx` - Added Send Invoice button
- `src/pages/InvoiceDetails.jsx` - Added Send Invoice button for staff

### 🔧 **Configuration**

#### Cloudflare R2 Settings:
```javascript
const R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID = process.env.CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_KEY_ID || '18ff8da7fb8b39edc132389c80aea4e1';
const R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = process.env.CLOUDFLARE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY || 'cc71c19220d512f47dfd1acb26c78ec6ff5191892017ec9e37524412f79eb5d2';
const R2_BUCKET = process.env.CLOUDFLARE_BUCKET || 'vetvault';
const R2_ACCOUNT_ID = process.env.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID || '63a5108742d66ea812f09f4fd0e506fa';
```

#### Environment Variables (Production):
```bash
# Backend (server.js) - Set these in your production environment
CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
CLOUDFLARE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
CLOUDFLARE_BUCKET=your_bucket_name
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
```

**Note**: For security, R2 credentials should be kept on the backend. The frontend should call a backend API endpoint for file uploads.

## Usage

### 🚀 **For Staff Users**

1. **From Invoice List**:
   - Navigate to Billing page
   - Find the invoice you want to send
   - Click the "Send Invoice" button
   - Wait for processing (PDF generation → R2 upload → WhatsApp sending)
   - Receive success/error notification

2. **From Invoice Details**:
   - Open any invoice detail page
   - Click "Send Invoice" button in the top-right
   - Same process as above

### 📋 **Eligibility Criteria**

An invoice can be sent if:
- User is a staff member (has staff session)
- Invoice status is "draft" or "sent"
- Invoice has a client assigned
- Client has a phone number

### 🔄 **Process Flow**

1. **Validation**: Check if invoice can be sent
2. **Data Fetching**: Get invoice, client, and pet details
3. **PDF Generation**: Create professional PDF using jsPDF
4. **R2 Upload**: Upload PDF to public Cloudflare R2 bucket
5. **Database Update**: Update invoice with public URL and sent date
6. **WhatsApp Sending**: Send invoice via WhatsApp with public link
7. **User Feedback**: Show success/error toast notification

## Technical Architecture

### 📊 **Service Layer**
```
InvoiceList/InvoiceDetails
    ↓
invoiceService.sendInvoice()
    ↓
├── generateInvoicePDF() → jsPDF
├── uploadToR2() → Cloudflare R2
├── updateInvoice() → MongoDB
└── sendWhatsApp() → Backend API → WhatsApp API
```

### 🔐 **Security Features**
- Tenant isolation (multi-tenant support)
- Public R2 access for customer convenience
- Backend API proxy for WhatsApp (avoids CORS issues)
- Error handling without exposing sensitive data
- Validation of user permissions
- Optional backend serving for authenticated access

### 📱 **WhatsApp Integration**
- **Template-Based**: Uses WhatsApp Business API template "send_bill"
- **Professional Format**: Structured message with customer name, amount, and invoice link
- **Real API**: Integrated with MyOperator WhatsApp Business API
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with API response logging

## Error Handling

### 🚨 **Common Errors**
- **Client not found**: Invoice has no associated client
- **Missing phone**: Client has no phone number for WhatsApp
- **PDF generation failed**: jsPDF issues (formatting, data)
- **Upload failed**: R2 upload issues (network, permissions)
- **WhatsApp failed**: WhatsApp API issues

### 🛠 **Error Recovery**
- Detailed error messages in toast notifications
- Graceful degradation (fallback to message if document fails)
- No partial state corruption (atomic operations)

## Future Enhancements

### 🔮 **Planned Features**
- **Email Integration**: Send invoices via email as backup
- **SMS Fallback**: SMS notification if WhatsApp unavailable
- **Batch Sending**: Send multiple invoices at once
- **Scheduling**: Schedule invoice sending for specific times
- **Templates**: Customizable WhatsApp message templates
- **Analytics**: Track sending success rates and delivery status

### 🔧 **Technical Improvements**
- **Real R2 Integration**: Replace mock with actual AWS SDK for R2
- **Public Bucket Setup**: Configure R2 bucket for public access
- **Custom Domain**: Set up custom domain for R2 bucket URLs
- **WhatsApp Templates**: Create additional WhatsApp message templates
- **PDF Templates**: More sophisticated PDF layouts
- **Caching**: Cache generated PDFs for performance
- **Webhooks**: Real-time delivery status updates

## Testing

### 🧪 **Test Scenarios**
1. **Valid Invoice**: Staff sends invoice with valid client/phone
2. **Missing Client**: Invoice without client (should show error)
3. **Missing Phone**: Client without phone number (should show error)
4. **Network Issues**: Simulate upload failures
5. **WhatsApp Failures**: Simulate WhatsApp API issues

### 🎯 **Implementation Status**
Current implementations:
- Cloudflare R2 upload (mock - ready for real integration)
- WhatsApp sending (real MyOperator API integration)
- PDF generation (actual jsPDF)

**Security Note**: R2 credentials are currently in the frontend for development. For production, move the R2 upload logic to the backend API to keep credentials secure.

Replace mocks with real implementations for production.
