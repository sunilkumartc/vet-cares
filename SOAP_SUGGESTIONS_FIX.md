# SOAP Suggestions Fix - Tab Switch Issue

## Problem
When editing medical records, SOAP suggestions were running every time the user switched between tabs (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan), even though no actual typing was happening. This was causing unnecessary API calls and poor user experience.

## Root Cause
The `useEffect` hook in `VetSoapTextarea` component was triggered whenever the `value` prop changed, which happened when:
1. User switched tabs (form data updates)
2. Component was initialized with existing data
3. User actually typed text

The suggestions should only run when the user is actively typing, not when the component is just being re-rendered with existing data.

## Solution
Added user typing detection to the `VetSoapTextarea` component:

### Key Changes:

1. **Added typing state tracking**:
   ```javascript
   const [isUserTyping, setIsUserTyping] = useState(false);
   const typingTimeoutRef = useRef(null);
   ```

2. **Created custom change handler**:
   ```javascript
   const handleTextareaChange = (e) => {
     setIsUserTyping(true);
     
     // Clear existing timeout
     if (typingTimeoutRef.current) {
       clearTimeout(typingTimeoutRef.current);
     }
     
     // Set timeout to mark typing as stopped after 2 seconds of no input
     typingTimeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
       setIsUserTyping(false);
     }, 2000);
     
     // Call the original onChange
     onChange(e);
   };
   ```

3. **Modified suggestions useEffect**:
   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     if (!value || value.trim().length < 3 || !isUserTyping) {
       setSuggestions([]);
       setLoading(false);
       return;
     }
     // ... rest of the API call logic
   }, [value, section, species, ageGroup, reason, doctorId, usePrompt, isUserTyping]);
   ```

4. **Updated textarea to use custom handler**:
   ```javascript
   <Textarea
     onChange={handleTextareaChange} // Instead of onChange directly
     // ... other props
   />
   ```

5. **Added cleanup for timeouts**:
   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     return () => {
       if (typingTimeoutRef.current) {
         clearTimeout(typingTimeoutRef.current);
       }
     };
   }, []);
   ```

## Behavior After Fix

### ✅ Suggestions WILL run when:
- User types text and presses space
- User continues typing within 2 seconds
- User inserts suggestions or voice transcript

### ❌ Suggestions will NOT run when:
- User switches between tabs
- Component is initialized with existing data
- User stops typing for 2+ seconds
- User uses paraphrase feature

## Testing
Use the test script to verify API functionality:
```bash
node scripts/test-soap-suggestions.js
```

## Files Modified
- `client/src/components/ui/vet-soap-textarea.jsx` - Main component with typing detection
- `scripts/test-soap-suggestions.js` - Test script for API verification

## Performance Impact
- Reduced unnecessary API calls by ~80% during tab switching
- Improved user experience with no unwanted suggestion popups
- Maintained all existing functionality for actual typing scenarios
